## TabbyDOC

_Tabular Document Analysis Research Group at ISDCT SB RAS_

Our aim is to develop a methodology and software for automating the conversion of tabular data from unstructured to a structured form. We create possibilities for extracting and transforming data from arbitrary tables presented in text documents and spreadsheets, for both loading them into relational databases and storing as linked data.
